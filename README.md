# Bi-directional-logic-level-converter

The PCB here is extension for ST NUCLEO 144 Boards to work with 5V periphery. There are twenty 5V-tolerant pins, that connected to controller via BSS138 MOSFET. There are also twelve pins with 3.3V logic only.  

There are all gerbers you need to make PCB in the repo.
